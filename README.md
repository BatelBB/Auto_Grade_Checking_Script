# auto_grade_checking_script
This script runs in the backround and checks if there are grade updates in the "Gezer" website. The file locations and my site credentials are on a private file. If you want to use this script create a "Credentials.py" file and fill the missing arguments. 

For now this script only works on the first row in the website. 
To add more rows you need to find the ```XPATH``` of these rows.
